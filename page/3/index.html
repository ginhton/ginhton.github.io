<li>Spacemacs: paste into minibuffer</li>
<li>Is there a way to paste something into the minibuffer?</li>
<li>For example if I want to eval-expression and paste soemthing in there neither C-v or (obviously p) will work? There has to be a way.</li>
<li>Answer: C-y does work, but you can also paste into  the minibuffer from the default register with, e.g., M0m r e “ or M-m r e return – or by searching the contest of all registers: for example M-m r e test copied a while ago.</li>
<li>M-m is the default dotspacemacs-emacs-leader-key : it’s similar to SPC (which is hte default dotspacemacs-leader-ky), but the former is available where SPC would just insert a literal space character (like int the minibuffer). Personally, I’ve just set dotspacemacs-emacs-leadr-key to a very easily accessible key chord and used it everywhere instead of SPC.<br>Currently, C-c doesn’t access evil’s registers from within the minibuffer (though it does work eslewhere).</li>
<li>EDIT: When in ex-mode(:), you can indeed use C-r to paste from register into the minibuffer. Additionall,hy, you can switch to evil’s search module ( evvil-search-module ) in order to enable the same when searching with /. The evil search module also enables eil-delete-backward-word within the search minibuffer ( on C-w), as well as pasting the oword under the non-minibuffer’s cursor with C-r C-w.</li>
<li>EDIT: and if you’re using ivy, M-m r y ( counsel-yank-pop – this allows you to search your kill ring, which includes a lengthier history of copied text than the evil registers) also works in the minibuffer.</li>
<li>The <strong>dotspacemacs-emacs-leader-key</strong> is <strong>M-m</strong>, which means “Alt + m” in my keyboard.</li>
<li>GOPATH 环境变量用于指定这样一些目录：除$GOROOT 之外的包含GO项目源代码和二进制文件的目录。go install 和 go 工具会用到 GOPATH：作为编译后的二进制的存放目的地和import包时的搜索路径。</li>
<li>GOPATH 是一个路径列表，也就是可以同时指定多个目录。多个目录在Mac和Linux下通过”:”分割；Windows下通过”;”分割。</li>
<li>个人建议GOPATH中别设置多个路径，甚至不显示指定GOPATH。有些地方建议在设置了GOPATH之后，将$GOPATH/bin加入PATH中，这样可以方便的运行go install好的二进制程序。然而，当存在GOPATH中存在的多个路径时，这种写法只会将最后一个路径跟上bin。 在mac或linux下可以通过这种方式解决：<strong>${GOPATH//://bin:}/bin</strong></li>
<li>go-dep 原型依赖管理工具</li>
<li>读书之法，莫贵于循序而致精。 – 宋-朱熹《性理精义》</li>
<li>通过go build加上要编译的Go源文件名，我们即可以得到一个可执行文件，默认情况下这个文件的名字为源文件名去掉.go后缀。</li>
<li>与build命令相比，install 命令在编译源码后还会将可执行文件或库文件安装到约定的目录下。</li>
<li><strong>pip install: permission denied</strong>. We should really stop advising the use of sudo with pip install. It’s better to first try pip install –user. The  reason you shouldn’t use sudo is as follows: When you run pip with sudo, you are running arbitrary Python code from the Internet as a root user, which is quite a big security risk. If someone puts up a malicious project on PyPl and you install it, you give and attacker root access to your machine.</li>
<li>Could you please elaborate?</li>
<li>Flask的request.form和request.data有什么区别？首先使用这两个方法的前提是post或者put请求。两者的区别在于处理不同的mimetype类型的数据，返回值也不同。当minitype为application/x-www-form-urlencodeed或者multipart/form-data的时候，也就是我们所谓表单提交，访问request.form会返回一个包含解析过的表单对象的MultiDict,而request.data是空的。当flask遇到不能处理的mimetype时，请求的数据就不能被其他方式正常解析，这些方式包括request.form、request.json和request.files这几个常用的用来访问数据的属性。这时就把数据作为字符串存在request.data中。这里注意一下request.json需要application/json的mimetype类型。知道了这些处理数据的过程，那我们就可以对提交的数据进行拓展，定义一些自己专用的mimetype类型，并在Request类中定义处理专用mimetpe数据的方法，从而让我们实现更个性、与众不同的功能需求。</li>

<h2 id="2-Note"><a href="#2-Note" class="headerlink" title="2 Note"></a>2 Note</h2><ul>
<li>Set a time to think about what happened. Because I always think those things at night, I forget almost everything. So think more in daytime. And be kinder.</li>
<li>Most meaningful of today is =.=, e, nothing. I met a problem. How to raise and teach a child? Give him what he wants or love him? Maybe right or maybe wrong. Think that you don’t let your daughter use phone. If she will lose in communication with others. If you feel her safe now, but what about future, when she has to face internet, games and other attractions alone. There is a saying goes, “I don’t let you do this just for the consideration of you, just because I care you.”. I am between a parent and a child. I can find a method to make both of parent and child happy. And there are more things like that, diffult and seems unsolvable. </li>
<li>So what is the right way to love children?</li>
<li>Maybe as someone said before, everything will go well. I don’t need to think so much. Just focus on my current work.</li>
<li>Life is so hard. Why all we choose to LIVE, even LIVE LONG.</li>

<li>I think share secret to my friends is wonderful. They reduce my sarrow. I can feel their concern. I will become more sincere to my real friends. I will communicate with you more frequently. And make more friends. Be more open to this new world and my new life. Cheer up!</li>

<li>“The idea is each one will have a priority number . Each attack bumpes up the attackers’s priority number to the max and every cycle (meaing every attack scene we perform) we decrease each unit’s priority number with their speed. The unit with the lowest number attacks  next. We will use a priority queue to store these information.”</li>

<li>导师不是还有任务吗？</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>恩，是的。这个东西难受在：需要的知识我不会，也不知道学啥，也没有人告诉我你应该看看这一部分或那一部分。好吧，其实大家都不会。会的不屑一顾，不会的感觉就是用一个月的时间学习人家一个小时做出来的东西。</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>总是要开始的，没人是一开始就会的额。而且你这么抗拒的话，自己也被束缚得更加紧。还有就是，重复的动作可能会养成习惯。也就是说，有可能，一遇到需要做的东西，第一反应就是我不会，不想做，很难受。</li>

<li>有的，你要是不结婚生子，一直一个人的话还可以放纵。但是，你可能已经变了，没有那么洒脱。不，90后可能都要开始变了，开始踏踏实实的融入社会。就像青豆说的，也许好多事情不像你想象的那么难。</li>

<li>google’s new repository: Xi Editor</li>
<li>The xi editor project is an attempt to build a high quality text editor, using modern software engineering techniques. It is initially built for Mac OS X, using Cocoa for the user interface. There are also frontends for other operating systems available from third-party developes.</li>
<li>Goals include:<ul>
<li><strong>Incredibly high performance</strong>. All editing operation should commit and paint in under 16ms. The editor shoudl never make you wait for anything.</li>
<li><strong>Beauty</strong>. The editor should fit well on a modern desktop, and not look like a throwback from the ‘80s or ‘90s. Text drawing should be done with the best technology available(Core Text on Mac, Directrite on Windows, etc.), and support Unicode fully.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong>. Crashing, hanging, or losing work should never happen.</li>
<li><strong>Developer friendliness</strong>. It should be easy to customize xi editor, whether by adding plug-ins or hacking on the core.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Design and decisions</li>
<li>Here are some of the design decisions, and motivation why they shoud contribute to the above goals:</li>
<li>Separation into front-end and back-end modules. The front-end is responsible for presenting the user interface and drawing a screen full of text. The back-end (also known as “core”) holds the file buffers and is responsible for all potentially expensive editing operations.</li>
<li>Native UI. Cross-platform UI toolkits never look and feel quite right. The best technology for building a UI is the native framework of the plaatform. On Mac, that’s Cocoa.</li>
<li>Rust. The back-end needs to be extremely erformant. In particular, it should use little more memory than the buffers being edited. That level of performance is possible in C++, but Rust offers a much more reliable, and in many ways, higher level programming platform.</li>
<li>A persistent rope data structure. Persistent ropes are efficient even for very large files. In addition, they present a simple interface to their clients - conceptually, they’re a sequence of characters just like a string, and the client need not be awre of any liternal structure.</li>
<li>Asynchronous operations. The eidtor shoudl never, ever block and pervent the user form getting their work done. For example, autosave will spawn a sthread with a snpashot of the current editor buffer (the persistent rope data structure is copy-on-wirte so this operation is nearly free), which can then proceed to write out to disk at its leisure, while the buffer is still fully editable.</li>
<li>Plug-ins over scriping. Most text editors have an associated scripting language for extending functionality. However, these languages are usually both more arcane and less powerful than “real” languages. The xi editor will communicate with plugins through pipes, letting them be written in any language, and making it easier to integrate with other systems such as version control, deep static analyzers of code, etc.</li>
<li>JSON. the protocol for font-end / back-end communication, as well as between the back-end and plug-ins, is based on simple JSON messages. I considered binary foramts, but the actual improvement in performance would be completely in the noise. Using JSON considerably lowers friction for develping plug-ins, as it’s available out fo the box for most modern languages, and there are plenty of hte libraries available for the other ones.</li>

<li>不喜欢吃猪肝。</li>
<li>you are so stupid.</li>
<li>I think doing is much harder than saying or giving ideas.</li>
<li>I am happy now. I hope I can happy for a long time.</li>
<li>I hope everyone in my lab can graduate sooner. And we can get along well with each other.</li>
<li>Life so long and have nothing to do for common people. So we choose to waste our time. For example, watch a moon, play games or just talking. But we shouldnot be blamed, because there is no real meaning for life. We define it. So just persue happy and feel happy. And if time or condition changes, change your mind and action accordingly.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-Copy"><a href="#2-Copy" class="headerlink" title="2 Copy"></a>2 Copy</h2><ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Love-Yourself" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.wikihow.com/Love-Yourself</a></li>
<li>rewrite your internal script. When You realize that you are thinking negatively for yourself, acknowledge the feeling, identify the source of the feeling and hten consciously make a new statement re-writing your thought as a more positive one.</li>
<li>For example, if you forgot to send an important work-related email, you may find yourself thinking “I am so stupid! How could I have done that?” </li>
<li>Stop yourself, and think “I feel stupid right now because I forgot to send the email. When I would forget to don things as a child, my father would tell me that I was stupid. These are his words, not my own, in my head.” then think to yourself, “I am a competent employee who made a human mistake, and I will be sure to write myself a reminder in the future. For now, I will send the email along with an apology for not sending it before.”</li>
<li>Method 2 - Exercising Self-Love</li>
<li>List your positive attributes and reflect on them daily. This can be difficult for someone who habittually thinks negatively of themselves, but try to find one positive thing about yourself to add to the list once a week. At the end of each day, reflect on your entire list.</li>
<li>Make your list very specific. Instead of using general adjectives to describe yourself, try listing specific actions or attributes that describe who you are and what you do.</li>
<li>For example, instead of simply saying “I am genrous,” you can write “Any time I know that a friend is struggling, I give her a small, thoughtful gift to show that I care. This makes me generous.”</li>
<li>As you read and reflect on your list, remember that each item on the list, however insignificant it may seem, is a reason tht you are worthy of respect and love.</li>
<li>Give yourself the gift of time. Do not feel guilty for spending time thinking about and reflecting on yourself and your own life. It is important to give yourself the time and permission for self-love. You will likely find that by doing so, you are more able to spend quality time helping others.</li>
<li>Celebrate and reward yourself. This is the fun part of self-love: rewarding yourself! If you have had a significant accomplishment, celebrate it with a nice dinner at your favorite fancy restaurant. Think of all of the hard work you do every day, and find a reason to reward yourself with something nice. Buy yourself the new book or video game you’ve had your eye on. Take a long shower or bubble bath. Go on a solo fishing trip or get a message.</li>
<li>Develop a plan for dealing with setbacks or negativity. Notice what tends to throw you off from your current path of self-love, and decide how to deal with those things. Realize that you cannot control the words and actions of others, but you can control your responses and reactions.</li>
<li>You may notice that negative comments from one particular person, such as your mom or your boss, set you off into a spiral of negativity. If this happens consistently, try to identify why this is.</li>
<li>Decide how you will deal with negative thoughts you do have. You may need to give yourself a time-out to meditate or breathe. Acknowledge your feelings and reframe your negative reaction with positive reminders of your self-worth.</li>
<li>Visit a therapist. Exploring negative thoughts and identifying triggers for your emotions can bring up feelings or memories from your past that are difficult to deal with.</li>
<li>A therapist who is experienced with addressing painful pasts can help you navigate through the experience of recovery without causing you to relive painful experiences.</li>
<li>A therapist’s office can be a great place to learn to handle your negative thoughts productively and realize your positive qualities.</li>
<li>Repeat positive affirmations daily. find some positive rhoughts that help you feel better, and repeat them daily. This may seem awkward or cheesy at first, but the habit will cause the positive thoughts to sink in, and you will begin to believe them, even if you don’t at first.</li>
<li>A good positive affirmation to pormote self-love is: “I am a whole, worthy individual, and I respect, trust, and love myself.”</li>
<li>If you find that the affirmations are not helping one their own, try visiting a therapist and pursuing a multi-level treatment that includes other approaches as well.</li>
<li>Do things that make you feel good. Think of feeling good physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Do what it takes to feel good in multiple ways; it may require exercise, meditation, dancing and keeping a positivity journal. Find a routine that feels good and stick to it.</li>
<li>Spend time alone doing activities you love, or take yourself on a fun outing such as going to the movies or even going out to eat, whether it be pizza or your favorite dessert. Don’t forget to take advantage of alone time and use it for pleasure!</li>
<li>Reflect on the effects of practicing self-love. When you spend time loving and rewarding yourself, you will likely see benefits in other areas of your life. Notice whether you have more energy, or if you are able to be more present with others. You might start to feel like you are more in charge of the choices you make, and that you have more control of your life.</li>
<li>Method - 3 - Practicing Loving-Kindness Meditation</li>
<li>Understand Loving-Kindness Meditation (LKM). LKM is a form of meditation that enhances your feeling of kindness for yourself and others. LKM can give you the tools that you need to become proficient in self-love.</li>
<li>Embrace the principles of LKM. Loving-Kindness Meditation involves loving without the imposition of expectations or conditions. It encourages you to love without judgment (either of yourself or others).</li>
<li>Judgments of ourselves or others often causes misery in relationships with others or in our own minds. Learning to love without judgment is learning to love selflessly.</li>
<li>breathe deeply. Begin with breathing in slowly and deeply. Sit comfortably in a chair and allow your chest to fill completely with air, expanding from your diaphragm. Then exhale slowly and completely.</li>
<li>Support yourself with positive affirmations. As you continue your deep beraths, begin repeating the following affirmatinos to yourself:</li>
<li>May I achieve my dreams and live in happiness and peace.</li>
<li>May I love love others with my whole heart.</li>
<li>I wish for myself and my family to be protected from harm.</li>
<li>May I learn to forgive myself and others.</li>
<li>Identify negative responses you have to the positive affirmations. If you find yourself thinking negative thoughts while you are repeating these affirmations, think about who is triggering these negative thoughts. Identify people towards whom you have difficulty feeling unconditional love. Repeat your affirmations, thinking about these people.</li>
<li>Think about someone you feel positively towards. Repeart the affirmations, keeping that person in your mind as you repeat them.</li>
<li>Think of someone you feel neutral about. Repeat the affirmations, keeping that person about whom you feel neutral in mind.</li>
<li>Allow the positivity from the affirmations to fill you completely. Repeat the affirmations without thinking of anyone in particular. Focus instead on the positivity of the affirmations. Allow the feelings of positivity to fill you completely, and send that positivity out from yourself to the entire planet.</li>
<li>Repeat a final mantra of love. Once you have extended feelings of positivity everywhere, repeat the following mantra: “May all living humans feel and be joyous, happiness, and healthfulness.” Repeat this affirmation five times as you feel the words resonate in your body and extend out to everything in the universe.</li>
<li>Method - 4 - Understanding Self-Love</li>
<li>Know the dangers of a lack of self-love. A lack of self-love can lead you to make harmful choices. A lack of self-love often equates to a lack of self-worth that leads to conscious or unconscious self-sabotage and prevents individuals from advocating for their own basic need. </li>
<li>Lack of self-love can lead to a harmful dependence on others for validation. Relying on others for validation often leads people to set aside their own needs in order to gain others’ approval.</li>
<li>Lack of self-love can also prevent emotional healing and progress: one study showed that individuals who engage in self-blame and ignoring themselves had poorer outcomes in psychotherapy.</li>

<li>Everyone’s heard this self-help platitude: We need to love ourselves before we can love anyone else. This may sound wise, but is misses a great truth; if we want to experience true intimacy, we need to be taught to love aspects of ourselves – again and again – by the people around us.</li>
<li>As much as we want to control our own destiny, the humbling truth is that sometimes the only way to learn self-love is by being loved-precisely in the places where we feel most unsure and most tender. When that happens, we feel freedom and relief and permission to love in a deeper way. No amount of positive self-talk can replicate this experience. It is a gift of intimacy, not of will-power.</li>
<li>Yet if our vulnerability is met with derision or desinterest, something tender shrivels and retracts within us, and we may think twice about ever sharing that part again. In my favorite Chipmunks episode, Simon falls head over heels in love, but has no idea how to win the (chip) girl’s heart. Dave exhorts him, “Just be yourself.” In response, Simon wails, “I tried that already!” When our authentic self doesn’t work in the world, we create a false self which lets us feel safe and accepted – but at significant cost. The great psychoanalytic theorist Donald Winnicot said, “Only the true self can be creative and only the ture self can feel real.” I would add that only the true self can bear the risk of deep intimacy.</li>
<li>Every time we fae the choice to share our deeper self, we stand at a precipice. Often, it’s just too scary to take the step forward.</li>
<li>Imagine taking a pet you love and puting it in a yard with an invisible electric fence. When it moves outside its allowed space, it gets stunned by an unexpected shock. It will only take a few jolts before your pet gets the message: if it goes too far, punishment will be instantaneous. In a short period of time, your pet won’t act as if the borders even exist; it will simply avoid them. If pushed closer to the danger zone, it will exhibit increasing signs of anxiety. The world outside the fense just isn’t worth the pain.</li>
<li>Now imagine turning off the charge from the invisible fence, and then placing a bowl of food outside its perimeter. Your pet might be starving, but it will still be terrifed to enter into the newly free space. And when it finally crosses the line, it does so with trembling; anticipating the pain of new shocks. It is the same with us; even though we yearn for the freedom of our true self, some deep reflexive instinct still tries to protect us from being hurt again.</li>
<li>We can each learn more about our true and false selves by answering these two questions:<ul>
<li>What parts of your authentic self did you have to hide or camouflage in your childhood?</li>
<li>In your current relationships, where are you confined to too small a space? What parts of yourself are you not expressing?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In my work as a psychotherapist, I’ve found that we tend to be ashamed of our most unique, passionate and iconoclastic parts. These aspects of ourselves threaten our safety, but as I explain in my Book, they are the direct path to lvoe and, not incidentally, to personal greatness. When we suppress these challenging gifts, we’re left with a sense of emptiness and loneliness.</li>
<li>This shame around our most vulnerable attributes is almost universal. And even our best thinking will barely budge it.</li>
<li>So, how do we free ourselves from the thrall of learned shame and fear around our gifts? The best – sometimes the only – way out is through relationships; relationships which instruct us in the worth of our most vulnerable self.</li>
<li><p>Of the people you know, who sees and relishes your true self? Who isn’t too afraid of your passion, or too envious of your gifts? Who has the generosity of spirit to encourage you toward greater self-expression? These people are gold. Practice learning on them more, and giving more back to them. They are, quite simply, the way out. They are what I call relationships of inspiration, and we usually need to build these relationships into in our non-romantic lives before we find them in our romantic partners. When you date someone like this, recognize what progress you’ve make to let them in, and celebrate that. In future, posts, I will describe the path to building more of these relationships into our lives.</p>

<li>How to Love Yourself</li>
<li>Sometimes it seems easier to love others than it does to love yourself, but self-acceptance is an important part of developing healthy relationships with others. Luckily, with a little practicce and patience, you can learn to love yourself, too.</li>
<li>In a Hurry?</li>
<li><p>To learn to love yourself, practice reframing evens in your life in a positive light, and don’t worry about trying to be perfect. Instead of allowing outside opinions to affect how you see yourself, focus on the things you like about yourself and keep working towards your goals. Be you won biggest cheerleader and wrok towards overcoming obstacles instead of calling yourself names or assuming the worst will always happen. Keep reading to learn how to use positive affirmations to improve your self-confidence.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Method 1: Improving Your Inner Voice</p>
</li>
<li>Overcome negagive beliefs about yourself. Many people have trouble letting go of negative thoughts that they have about themselves. These negative thoughts often come from outside people whose opinion we value and from whom we seek love and acceptance.</li>
<li>Avoid perfectionism. Some people have trouble accepting anything less thatn perfection from themselves. If you find yourself pursuing perfectionism and feeling negatively about yourself when you are less than perfect, take three simple steps. Stop your current line of thinking, then focus on the effort that will be required to work towards a goal, then steadily apply the erquired effort.</li>
<li>Changing your focus from a final product (which may be evaluated in terms of “perfection”) to the effort behind a task (which is harder to quantify as “perfect”) can help you appreciate your own good work.</li>
<li>Discard your negative filter. Focusing only on the negatives in your life is a bad habit. Excessive focus on negative or less favorable events in your life can make these events seem disproportionately important. If you find yourself complaining that everything that happens to you is bad, try to find a little evidence to the contrary; it is very unlikely that everything is really bad.</li>
<li>Never call yourself names. Calling yourself a name is reducing yourself from a human to a single element of yourself that you do not like.</li>
<li>Saying “I am such a failure” after getting fired from a job is inaccurate and unfair to you. Instead, make the useful comment, “I lost my job, but I can use this experience to find and keep a new job.”</li>
<li>Saying “I am so stupid” is also likely untrue and reductive. If you feel stupid, it’s more likely that you have a lack of knowledge about something. Instead, think, “I don’t know how to do this basic home maintenance. Perhaps I could take a class and learn to do this in the future.”</li>
<li>Do not assume that the worst can happen. It can be easy to fall into the assumption that the very worst outcome will happen with every situation.
