<li>read one chapter blog about common lisp.</li>
<li>try to give up gaming (Well, again. Though I failed a lot of times)</li>
<li>read a chapter of ZhiLe</li>
<li>downloads a bunch of songs. listen and listen.</li>
<li>Well, stop taking note. I want to write down the things about myself. Because of the fear of reading paper and writing paper(well, maybe not fear, but laziness), I failed to graduate this term. It is really a bad thing. I can accept it and it&rsquo;s all my fault. I still have no courage and confidence to do my paper. I don&rsquo;t know how can I finish the work that I cannot finish in past two-three year. A little bit hopeless. But everyone has graduated, maybe I can also graduate in next term or next year? After spending several months playing game, actually from New Year to now, I think I should do some change. So recently I put my phone down, and try to read something maybe useful. Well, I want to read paper, but I don&rsquo;t want. Complicate to express that feeling. It is a good choice to start reading paper and modify my code now. But I just want delay it a little bit and do something else now, for example, read lisp blogs. Things will change, I think. The best thing I do today, is that I try to download a paper related to my work. I will read it tomorrow. It is just a small step toward my work, but very encouraging for me. After so many days, finally I manage to do something related.</li>
<li>By the way, I have more time when I start to put down my phone and try to not play game, any game. It makes me feel good. But there is a time that I feel so bored and sleepy with only reading blogs and without game. Not a good feeling. I overcome that feeling several times till now. Well, I am so good. ( I think this is worth praising).</li>
<li>Here is still some bad habits within me. The first one is getting up late and sleep late. In recent two days, I try to sleep early, but many ideas appear when the light turns off. I think too much sleep in the afternoon may be the cause. So this afternoon I try to not sleep. We will see tonight.</li>
<li>I forget how to write a journal or blog well. Maybe this blog is somewhat messy. I will improve later.</li>
<li>Thanks for myself. Thanks for my parents. Thanks for my friends.</li>
